NeuroCare Project - Staff Dashboard and Database Management

This repository contains the code for the **NeuroCare project**, which focuses on developing a platform to manage and track neurocare services. Currently, I am working on designing and managing the **Staff Dashboard**, with a primary focus on **database integration** and ensuring smooth communication between the dashboard and the backend.

The main features I am working on include the **Staff Dashboard**, where I am designing and implementing a user-friendly interface that allows staff to manage and track important information such as patient data, schedules, and daily tasks. Additionally, I am responsible for **database integration**, handling the connection between the Staff Dashboard and the **MySQL database**. This involves setting up the necessary database schema, ensuring real-time data updates, and enabling efficient querying and storage of data. I am also focusing on **role-based staff management**, organizing staff data within the database, and handling the management of staff roles, schedules, and tasks.

 Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React, if applicable)
- **Backend**: Node.js (using Express.js framework)
- **Database**: MySQL for managing and storing data
- **Development Tools**: (Mention any other tools you're using, e.g., Postman for API testing, Sequelize for database ORM, etc.)

Current Focus:
- **Database Connection**: I am currently setting up and optimizing the connection between the dashboard and the **MySQL database** to ensure real-time updates and efficient data retrieval.
- **Staff Data Management**: I am building and optimizing SQL queries to store, retrieve, and update staff-related data efficiently, and ensuring data consistency and security.
- **Interface Design**: I am working on designing a clean and intuitive dashboard interface that will allow staff to easily access and update information.
Future Goals:
  -Authentication: I plan to implement user authentication using technologies like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to securely manage user roles and permissions.
- Deployment: The next steps involve deploying the platform to a cloud service like **AWS** for live access.
- Additional Features: In the future, I aim to add features such as notifications, data analytics, and more to enhance the functionality of the platform.
